    "The idea behind the __BinomialController__ is to assign a likelihood of collision $P_\\theta(y|\\pi) \\sim Binom(y, n, \\pi)$ for each whole degree heading $\\theta \\in 1..360$ within a sliding window of $n=N$ (configured currently to 10) using the binomial  distribution $Binom_\\theta(n,y,\\pi)$ where $\\pi$ is the expected proportion of the collision event. The beta-binomial distribution is used to update the initial uniform parameter prior $P_\\theta(\\pi)$ based on observation of either a collision, or limited _travel_ between the current state (which includes the position read from the odometer) and the last state. \n",
    "\n",
    "When either a collision occurs or when the distance travelled is less than a configured threshold, the update rules are applied to produce the posterior distribution for the parameter and heading pair $P_\\theta(\\pi|y)$ where the number of trials and \"collisions\" are incremented.\n",
    "\n",

    "Hence the probability of collision $P_\\theta(y|\\pi)$ can be calculated by the expected value of the proportion $\\pi$. Using the beta-binomial distribution the expected value of $\\pi$ can be estimated using \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the bayesian update rules for the beta-binomial, a kind of memory for the sliding window is created which allows the angle $\\theta$ to be used for the heading to keep track of successful or unsuccessful selections for $n = N$. The method _changeDirection_ makes use of the _selectLeastLikelihood_ in order to explore and gradually learn the headings which are currently most likely to result in __successful__ movement (any $RollCommand(\\theta, velocity)$ that results in travelling at least the minimum distance threshold). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is a short term memory depending on the size of $N$. Additionally the _selectLeastLikelihood_ method takes a $min$ and $max$ parameter to filter the allowed selection of possible $\\theta$.\n",

    "Further experimentation will also make use of some form of localisation such as a graph which collects coordinates recorded from the odometer, and maps those headings most likely to result in a collision to the associated coordinates. However this type of experimentation has not yet been implemented, as localisation has not yet been attempted (but will be at a later time).\n",
